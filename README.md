### App Evaluation

- **Story:** User can use song detection tool and listen to the song/add to playlist within the app. User can also see public playlists and artists' information
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app but an age restriction for explicit songs may be needed
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as daily
- **Scope:** The initial required functionalities are song recognition and song player. Eventually, this app could be expanded with more features such as adding/following friends and artists, sharing music to each other or to other platforms (social media), and having built-in lyrics tab
